# Custom-BITS-Impartus-v1-
I tried creating an updated version of impartus using swiftUI and custom API calls to get lectures

I tried using AVKit along with some predefined JSON to get along with an idea on how IMPARTUS 2.0 should work
I tried implementing the xcode project with a different folder structure and pushed it here with firebase and firestore dependencies
